# Analyzing Fitness Data to Uncover Activity Patterns and Health Outcomes

## Scope and Purpose

The aim of this project is to analyze user activity and fitness data to uncover patterns in physical behaviors and their correlations with health outcomes like calories burned. By understanding these patterns, the project seeks to provide insights that could help in designing better health and fitness interventions.

We utilize a one-month dataset adapted from [Fitbit Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

## Questions to Explore

1. What are the common patterns of physical activity among different users?
2. How do activity levels correlate with calories burned?
3. What is the trend of total steps and calories over time, including their relationship?
4. Are there any visible trends in activity levels over longer periods, such as weeks or months?
5. How do various activity levels (sedentary, light, moderate, very active) impact overall health metrics?


We performed extensive EDA to understand the distributions, correlations, and trends in our dataset. Key visualizations included histograms of activity metrics and scatter plots to examine the relationships between activity levels and calories burned.

The insights derived point out to helping users become more active by using pro-active approaches.
